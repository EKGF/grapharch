# Source &mdash; SPARQL endpoint

Scan a given database, pointed to with a given SPARQL endpoint URL,
for things to document such as:

- W3C OWL Ontologies
- W3C SKOS Taxonomies
- W3C SHACL Shapes
- W3C DCAT Datasets
- OMG DPROD Data Products
- OMG Use Cases (see EKGF Use Case Tree Workgroup)

Or, find "annotations" that people left behind in the graph,
that instruct GraphArch how to generate documentation.
