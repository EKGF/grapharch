# Target &mdash; PDF via Typst

Generate [typst](https://typst.app) files and a resulting PDF.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Typst is built with Rust itself which means that it
> is very easy to include it as part of GraphArch,
> allowing us to output PDFs without requiring any
> additional tool installations.
