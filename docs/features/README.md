# GraphArch Features

## General Features

- [**Ontology Precision**](./general/ontology-precision.md):
  GraphArch emphasizes governance and precision in documenting ontologies,
  schemas, and their relationships. It aims to deliver librarian-level
  accuracy of definitions, domain ownership, and control for enterprise data management.
- [**Business-Oriented Profiling**](./general/business-oriented-profiling.md):
  GraphArch offers capabilities for graph database endpoint analysis that
  can be particularly useful for business users to understand and describe
  their data in their own terms.
- [**Flexible Output Formats**](./general/flexible-output-formats.md):
  Documentation can be generated as user-friendly websites or professionally
  formatted PDF reports.
- [**Onboard Graph Engine**](./general/onboard-graph-engine.md):
  The tool includes [OxiGraph](https://github.com/oxigraph/oxigraph),
  a graph database that can be used to generate data for further documentation,
  integrating both input options seamlessly.
