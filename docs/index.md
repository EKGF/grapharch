# GraphArch Documentation

GraphArch is a tool that generates documentation from various types of sources.
It's primary focus is on generating documentation from graph databases, in particular
OWL ontologies and SHACL shapes.

[![.github/workflows/rust-ci.yml](https://github.com/EKGF/grapharch/actions/workflows/rust-ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/EKGF/grapharch/actions/workflows/rust-ci.yml) [![CLA assistant](https://cla-assistant.io/readme/badge/EKGF/grapharch)](https://cla-assistant.io/EKGF/grapharch)

**GraphArch** is an open-source tool developed
by the Enterprise Knowledge Graph Forum ([EKGF](https://ekgf.org)),
a Managed Community of the
Object Management Group ([OMG](https://www.omg.org/communities/enterprise-knowledge-graph-forum.htm)).

The tool aims to generate comprehensive
documentation for knowledge graphs, shape graphs,
labelled property graphs, semantic graphs, ontologies,
taxonomies, use cases, and more,
with outputs available as both websites (markdown) and
PDFs (see [Targets](features/targets/README.md)).

This project is part of an effort to streamline graph documentation
and governance, enhancing clarity and accessibility for
various stakeholders.
