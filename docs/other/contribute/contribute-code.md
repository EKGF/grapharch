## Getting Started (as a developer)

### Create an Issue

Before creating a branch, please create an
issue describing your intent.
This helps the community understand the
purpose of your work and allows for
discussion and feedback before you
begin implementation.

### Fork the Repository

Start by forking the repository to your
GitHub account.

### Clone the Repository

Clone the forked repository to your
local machine.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/ekgf/grapharg.git
cd GraphArch
```

### Create a Branch

Once your issue has been approved, create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.

```shell
git switch -c features/your-feature-name
```

### Make Your Changes

Implement your changes, make sure they are
well-tested, and follow the coding standards
of the project.

### Commit Your Changes

See [Git Commit Notes](git-commit.md) for more details.

### Create a Pull Request

Go to the original repository on GitHub and
open a pull request from your forked repository.
Describe your changes thoroughly in the pull
request description.
