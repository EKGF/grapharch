# Jekyll Notes

We're using Jekyll to build the documentation site (for now).
All documentation is in the `docs` directory of the [EKGF/GraphArch](https://github.com/ekgf/grapharch)
repository.

You're welcome to contribute to the documentation by editing the files in the `docs` directory
and submitting a pull request.
