# Ontology

The idea is to have source handling components that scan a given data source
for documentable items, such as a component that understands OWL Ontologies,
where that source handling component generates documentation objects such as
"chapter", "section" etc, according to an "documentation ontology", into a
temporary triple-store. From there, output-handling components like a PDF
generator or a website generator will create the most appropriate output.

This would allow for being able to generate consistent documentation as both
a website and a document, even though those two things are usually completely
different in structure.
