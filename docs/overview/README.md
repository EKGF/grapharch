# GraphArch Overview

GraphArch serves two primary use cases:

1. **Ontology and Schema Documentation**

   GraphArch can document ontologies,
   whether OWL-based or non-semantic tech,
   such as LPG graph schemas from platforms
   like Neo4j or TigerGraph.
   This includes individual ontologies as
   well as ontology families,
   where multiple related ontologies might
   be documented collectively, such as the
   Financial Industry Business Ontology (FIBO).

2. **Graph Database Endpoint or EKG Documentation**

   GraphArch can connect to graph database
   endpoints (SPARQL, Cypher, GSQL, etc.)
   and generate documentation through discovery.
   It analyzes the data structures, provides
   profiling, and creates reports based on the
   detected entities.
   This could include a breakdown of the classes,
   distribution of instances, identification of PII,
   and a summary of data models used,
   generating outputs like dashboards or reports.
