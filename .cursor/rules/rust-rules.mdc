# Rust Rules

- When a rust module is stored in a directory and not in a file, then
  this directory must have a mod.rs file as usual. But when there's a
  class in that module that has the same name as the module (in
  lower-kebab-case) then we always define that class in a file called `this.rs`
  next to `mod.rs`.
- Don't ask whether to proceed, just do it.
- Every class and trait should have rustdoc compliant documentation.
- Always update the documentation of a class or trait when important changes
  are made to the class or trait.
- Treat the documentation of a class or trait as if it were an instruction.
